# Connect to a portal

The page every screen in this track leans on: is there an ONLYOFFICE Apps
portal behind this page, and who does it think we are?

<ThemedImage alt="Default" width={790} sources={{ light: require('./connect-to-a-portal--default-light.png').default, dark: require('./connect-to-a-portal--default-dark.png').default }} />

Most readers see **Demo data** — nothing is configured, so the page renders its
own. That is deliberate: a documentation page that breaks without a portal is a
broken page, and every screen in this track keeps demo data behind the same
shape it fetches.

## Pointing it at your own portal

**On the published Storybook**, and anywhere you would rather not touch files:
the **API** control in the toolbar. It keeps the portal's URL and key in this
browser's `localStorage` and switches between saved portals per story. Nothing
leaves the browser.

**Working locally**, the same two values can live in `.env`:

```bash
# .env
VITE_PROVIDER_API_URL=https://your-portal.onlyoffice.com
VITE_PROVIDER_API_KEY=sk-...
```

A static build **drops both on purpose**. Vite inlines every
`import.meta.env.VITE_*` it reads, so without that a key in the builder's
`.env` would sit in plain text in `assets/iframe-*.js` of the published site —
`.storybook/main.ts` blanks them for production builds, and the published pages
start in demo mode.

Nothing else to wire: `.storybook/decorators/withApiProvider.tsx` already wraps
every story in `ApiProvider`, so `useApi()` works in any sample without a
provider of its own.

## The hook the rest of the track shares

`usePortal()` makes the two opening calls and turns them into four states —
`demo`, `loading`, `connected`, `error` — because those are the four different
things a screen has to say. The part worth copying is the classification of
failures:

| What came back | What it means | What the screen says |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 401 / 403 | the portal answered and refused the key | Key refused |
| no status at all | the browser never got an answer — nearly always CORS, sometimes a wrong host | No answer |
| any other status | the portal answered something unplanned | Unexpected answer |

Telling the second apart from the first is the whole point. A CORS failure
carries no status code, so it looks like a broken token, and that is how an
afternoon goes missing.

## Pictures from the portal need the key too

An avatar comes back as `/storage/userPhotos/…` — a path on the portal, and one
that answers **403** to a request that is not signed in. The ONLYOFFICE Apps client
never notices, because it is served from the portal's origin and the browser
sends the session cookie with every `<img>`. A page anywhere else has no such
cookie, and an `<img>` cannot carry a header.

So the picture is fetched with the key and handed to `<img>` as a blob:

```ts
const src = usePortalImage(user.avatarMedium); // blob:… once it arrives, "" until then

<Avatar source={src} userName={user.displayName} … />
```

`usePortalImage` resolves the path against the portal, requests it through the
provider's own axios client — which already carries `Authorization` — and turns
the answer into an object URL. It sends the key **only to the portal's host**: an
absolute URL anywhere else is returned untouched, because signing a request to
a third party hands them the key. It revokes the object URL when the path
changes, and on any failure returns `""`, so `Avatar` draws initials rather
than a broken image.

This works from any origin, the published Storybook included, because the
portal answers both `/api/2.0` and `/storage` with
`Access-Control-Allow-Origin: *` and allows the `Authorization` header. The
request must not send credentials: a wildcard origin and cookies do not mix,
which is one more reason the key travels as a header.

## Whose identity is this?

An API key is **one user** — the key's owner. It is the right shape for the
lawyer's workspace, where the application acts for the firm, and the wrong one
for a client cabinet that claims to show a client only their own matters:
filtering rooms by a client's name is a layout demonstration, not an
authorisation.

[Who is signed in](./who-is-signed-in.md)
takes that seriously: the portal's own session when the application is served
from its origin, and OAuth when it is not.

## The code

Imports here are relative to this repository. In your application they come
from the package — `@onlyoffice/apps-ui-kit/providers/api` for the provider and
the hook, and the component subpaths for everything the screen draws with.
