# Who is signed in

A law firm needs two applications from one portal: a workspace for its lawyers
and a cabinet for its clients. This screen decides which one a person gets —
and, more importantly, makes sure a client is really themselves.

<ThemedImage alt="Default" width={790} sources={{ light: require('./who-is-signed-in--default-light.png').default, dark: require('./who-is-signed-in--default-dark.png').default }} />

## Three routes, and they are not interchangeable

| Route | Whose identity | Good for |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **API key** | the key's owner, always | the lawyer's workspace — the application acts for the firm |
| **Portal session** | whoever is signed in to the portal | an application the portal serves itself, like a plugin |
| **OAuth** | the person who signed in and allowed the app | a client cabinet hosted anywhere |

The API key from
[Connect to a portal](./connect-to-a-portal.md)
is one person. Filtering rooms by a
client's name on top of it would look like a cabinet and behave like a data
leak: every client would be one URL edit away from every other client's
matters. The portal session is the ONLYOFFICE Apps client's own route — it passes the
`asc_auth_key` cookie to `ApiProvider` as `apiKey` — and works only for a page
the portal serves. That leaves OAuth for a client cabinet on its own domain.

## The persona comes from the portal

`personaFromRoles` reads the portal's own flags. A client is invited as a
**guest**, who sees only the rooms shared with them; a room admin is a lawyer,
because room admins open matters and decide who joins them. Keeping a second
list of roles in the application would drift the first time someone's type
changes on the portal.

## Signing a client in with OAuth

### 1. Register the application on the portal

**With the portal already connected by its API key, press _Create the OAuth
app_.** It registers exactly what the sign-in needs — PKCE on, this page's
redirect URI and origin, the scopes below, one of the kit's icons — fills in the
Client ID, and links to the app's page in the portal's Developer Tools. Press it
again and it finds the app it made rather than registering a second one.

The button needs `pnpm storybook`. Registering an app is two portal calls: the
API key buys a five-minute JWT from `GET /api/2.0/security/oauth2/token`, and
`POST /api/2.0/oauth2/clients` takes it in an `x-signature` header. The first
answers any origin. The second is the portal's identity service, which refuses
every CORS preflight — 403, even for the portal's own origin, which never sends
one — so no page on another host can reach it. `.storybook/oauth-app-proxy.ts`
makes both calls from the dev server instead. It answers one path, POST only,
from this dev server's own pages, and forwards to those two routes and nothing
else.

The portal also wants a home page, terms, a privacy policy and a logout
redirect, and checks those four against a pattern that needs a dotted host name
or an IPv4 address: `http://localhost:6006/…` is refused with 400, although the
redirect URI and the origin may name `localhost`. On a dev server the four
therefore point at `https://www.onlyoffice.com`; an application of your own
points them at its real pages. When the portal refuses, the screen shows which
fields and why — the registry names each one in the `errors` of its answer.

**In a static build** — the published Storybook — the button becomes a link to
the portal's own form, **Developer Tools → OAuth → Create app**:

- tick **Allow public client (PKCE)** — without it the portal asks for a
  client secret, and a secret in a browser bundle is not a secret;
- add the redirect URI and the allowed origin this screen shows;
- give it the scopes a client needs and nothing more:
  `openid accounts.self:read rooms:read files:read files:write`.

Either way the **Client ID** ends up in the field above. It is not a secret — a
public client's id never is — so the screen remembers it in `localStorage`.

### 2. What happens on **Sign in with ONLYOFFICE**

1. A popup opens at the portal's `authorize` endpoint with the client id, the
   redirect URI, the scopes, a `state` nonce and an S256 `code_challenge`.
2. The client signs in on the portal and presses **Allow**.
3. The portal sends the popup to `oauth-callback.html?code=…&state=…`. That page
   posts both to this window and closes.
4. This window checks `state` and exchanges the code, together with the
   `code_verifier` that never left it, for an access token.
5. A nested `ApiProvider` gets the token as `apiKey`. Everything below it — here
   one `getSelfProfile()` — runs as the client.

The endpoints come from the portal's own
`/.well-known/openid-configuration`, and both it and the token endpoint answer
any origin, so a static page can do all of this with no server of its own.

### Details that decide whether it works

- **Open the popup inside the click, before any `await`.** Hashing the
  verifier first loses the user's gesture and the browser blocks the window. The
  hook opens a blank popup synchronously and points it at the portal once the
  challenge is ready.
- **Put `scope` last in the authorize URL.** The first time a person allows
  an app, the portal's consent page sends the browser round once more and
  rebuilds the authorize URL as everything before `&scope=` plus the scopes.
  Anything after `scope` is lost: `state` comes back missing and the exchange
  has no `code_challenge` to check the verifier against. The second sign-in
  works either way, which is what makes this one hard to see.
- **Answer by `postMessage`, checked twice.** Only messages from this origin,
  only with the `state` this request made. The kit's `utils/get-oauth-token`
  polls `localStorage` instead and checks no `state`, which is why this sample
  does not use it.
- **Keep the token in memory.** Anything that survives a reload can be read by
  any script on the page. A real cabinet adds refresh with the `refresh_token`
  the portal returns; this sample signs out on reload.
- **The callback is a plain `.html` file** in `.storybook/public/`. Storybook's
  dev server serves a static file only by its full path, and `serve` — behind
  `pnpm storybook-serve` — would redirect `*.html` to a clean URL and drop the
  query with the code in it, until the `serve.json` next to the page told it not
  to.

The challenge is base64url without padding, as S256 specifies, and
`pkce.test.ts` checks it against the worked example in RFC 7636 itself.

The app registered here is the one every later screen signs a client in with:
[01. My matters](../screens/my-matters.md) uses it
to show a client the matters shared with them, and nothing else.

## The code

Imports here are relative to this repository. In your application they come
from the package — `@onlyoffice/apps-ui-kit/providers/api` and the component
subpaths.
