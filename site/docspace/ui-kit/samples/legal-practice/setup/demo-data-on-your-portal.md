# Demo data on your portal

Every screen in this track runs on demo data when there is no portal. This
page puts that same data on a real one, so the screens can be tried against
rooms that exist: press the button, then open
[The cabinet](../the-cabinet.md).

## What it does

For each demo room, in the order the list shows them:

1. **Opens it rather than making it** if a room with that title is already
   on the portal, compared without regard to case or spacing. Whatever the
   demo puts inside and is missing — a tag, a folder, a file — is added, and
   a room that has it all is left alone. So a run that failed halfway is put
   right by the next press, and pressing twice creates nothing new.
2. **Creates a custom room** otherwise, with the demo's colour, as the owner
   of the API key. That person becomes the lead of every matter, which is
   the one thing the demo cannot copy.
3. **Tags it.** A tag has to exist on the portal before a room can carry it,
   so each is created first and the refusal for one that already exists is
   ignored; then the room gets them all in one call.
4. **Makes the folders**: `From the client` with a subfolder per request,
   `From the firm`, and whatever else the demo room has.
5. **Puts files where the demo shows them.** Office documents are made by the
   document server, so they open in the editor; a PDF is written on the spot,
   one page that says its own name, with a cross-reference table whose
   offsets are computed rather than hoped for; a PNG is one grey pixel.
6. **Shares the client's two matters** with the email given, as a content
   creator, so that person can upload. Leave the field empty and nothing is
   shared.

It never deletes. What it made is removed like any other room, from
ONLYOFFICE.

## The calls, and why they are behind an interface

The seeder speaks in its own words, `SeedClient`: create a room, tag it, make
a folder, put a document there, invite someone. `sdkSeedClient` is the one
place those words become SDK calls, and the test stands a recorder in for it.
Three of the calls are worth knowing:

- **`createRoom`** takes `tags`, but a tag it has never seen is dropped
  without a word. `createRoomTag` first, then `addRoomTags`, is what the
  portal's own client does.
- **The upload is not the SDK's `insertFile`.** That call sends the multipart
  fields as `InsertFile.Title` and `InsertFile.File`, the names the reference
  pages show, and a live portal answers 400, "Value cannot be null.
  (Parameter 'title')": the portal's binder reads a bare `title` and takes
  the first file part whatever it is called. So the bytes go as a plain
  `FormData` of `file`, `title` and `createNewIfExist`, through the same
  axios instance the SDK uses. It is one request, the right size for a file
  already in memory; the chunked session `Uploader` runs is for files a
  person chose.
- **`setRoomSecurity`** invites by `email`, though the SDK's `RoomInvitation`
  names only `id`. The portal takes both; the cast in the code says so.
