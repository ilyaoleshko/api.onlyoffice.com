# 04. Reading the firm's draft

The other half of the exchange. The firm puts a draft in `From the firm`;
the client presses **Read** and it opens where they are, in the ONLYOFFICE
editor, read-only. The lawyer presses **Open** on the same line and edits
it. Nothing is downloaded, nothing is attached to an email, and there is one
copy.

With no portal a page stands in for the editor, because there is no document
server to load one from. Connect a portal, sign the client in from
[Who is signed in](../setup/who-is-signed-in.md),
and the editor is the real one, minted for that client.

## One component, two calls and a script

`DocumentEditor` is the kit's wrapper around the ONLYOFFICE editor. Given a
file id it does three things through `useApi()`:

1. asks the portal where its document server is (`getDocServiceUrl`);
2. asks the portal for this file's editor configuration
   (`openEditFile`, with `view` when `isView` is set): the document's signed
   link, the editor's mode, and a token, all minted for whoever asked;
3. loads the editor script from that document server and mounts it with
   that configuration.

Under the client's `ApiProvider` all three happen as the client. So the
configuration is what the client may do in that room, and `isView` asks for
less than that: read, and comment. The lawyer, under the API key, gets the
same file in editing mode from the same control.

## What changed on the earlier screen

`MatterRoomPanel` took one more prop, `reading`. A document line in the
firm's folder now has a button beside the link to the portal, and the panel
mounts `DocumentReader` under the list for the one that was pressed. The
list itself, the checklist and the facts are untouched.

## Details worth copying

- **The document server is the portal's, and the browser has to reach it.**
  The editor script and the document's link both point at it. A server the
  portal knows but the reader's network cannot reach fails at load, which
  is what `onLoadComponentError` reports.
- **The reader must be a member of the room.** A file the portal will not
  show the client answers 403 to `openEditFile`, which arrives as the same
  error; the checklist and the drafts come from the same room, so a client
  who sees the line can open the file.
- **Every editor on a page needs its own `id`.** The editor mounts into an
  element by id; two readers with the same id fight over one element. The
  reader uses the file's id.
- **Wait for `events_onAppReady`.** The wrapper renders nothing until the
  configuration arrives, and the editor draws its own loading state after;
  the reader shows a loader until the editor says it is ready.
