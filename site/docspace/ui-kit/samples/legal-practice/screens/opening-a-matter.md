# 05. Opening a matter

The lawyer's side of the whole track in one form. A name, a practice, a
stage, the client's email and the documents to ask for; press **Open the
matter** and the room exists, tagged, with its two folders and the client in
it. Everything the other screens read was written here.

With no portal the matter goes into the demo portal, and the list, the
cabinet and the client's screens see it at once. Connect a portal and the
room is made on it, as the owner of the API key; give an email and that
person is added as a content creator, the role that lets them drop a file
into a request.

## Four writes, in a lawyer's order

`openMatter` is the same calls the demo-data page makes for the whole
practice, made once, for one matter, from a form:

| Step          | Call                              | Why it is this call                                                                           |
| ------------- | --------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Room          | `createRoom`                      | a custom room named after the matter; the colour is picked from the demo's palette by name    |
| Tags          | `createRoomTag`, then `addRoomTags` | `Practice: …` and `Stage: …`; a tag must exist on the portal before a room can carry it       |
| Checklist     | `createFolder`, once per line     | `From the client`, then a subfolder per ticked request; empty is what "still needed" means    |
| Firm's folder | `createFolder`                    | `From the firm`, where drafts for the client go                                               |
| Client        | `setRoomSecurity`                 | the email, as a content creator, the lowest role that may add a file to a folder              |

Each step is reported as it lands, and a refusal stops the run and names
the step. What was made before it stays: a half-made room is a room in
ONLYOFFICE that a lawyer finishes by hand, or that
[Demo data on your portal](../setup/demo-data-on-your-portal.md)
completes on its next press.

## The form, and why these components

- **`ModalDialog` as an aside**, with `withForm`: the body is a form, Enter
  submits, the footer's primary button is `type="submit"`, and `withBodyScroll`
  keeps a long form usable on a phone. `isCloseable` is off while the writes
  run, so a click on the backdrop cannot lose a half-made room out of sight.
- **`FieldContainer`** around every input: the label, the required mark and
  the error line in the kit's own spacing. The email field shows its own
  error; the rest of the form's errors are one sentence under the fields.
- **`ComboBox`** for practice and stage. Both are closed lists the firm
  edits in one constant; a free text field would give three spellings of
  "Real estate" and three matters that never filter together.
- **`Checkbox`** per request template, and a text field to add one the
  template does not have. Ticked lines become folders, in this order.
- **`EmailInput`** for the client, because the portal invites by email and
  refuses a malformed one after the room is already made; catching it here
  is cheaper.
- Not `PeopleSelector`: it browses people already on the portal, and a new
  client is usually not one yet. The email covers both cases, since the
  portal resolves an existing account by its address.
