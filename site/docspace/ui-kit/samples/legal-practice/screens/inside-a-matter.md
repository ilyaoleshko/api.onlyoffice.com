# 02. Inside a matter

The screen the whole track exists for. A client opens a matter and sees what
the firm still needs from them and what has arrived; a lawyer sees who sent
what, when, and asks for one more thing without leaving the page.

With no portal, both views read the demo rooms. Connect a portal from the
**API** control in the toolbar and the lawyer's view opens the key owner's
real matters; sign a client in with the app from
[Who is signed in](../setup/who-is-signed-in.md)
and the client's view opens theirs. The picker lists the matters from
[01. My matters](./my-matters.md).

## The checklist is a folder

A matter's room holds two folders with fixed names:

| Folder            | What it is                                                                                           |
| ----------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `From the client` | the checklist. One subfolder per document asked for: empty means still needed, a file inside means received |
| `From the firm`   | drafts and letters for the client to read                                                             |

Nothing else is recorded anywhere. A request is a folder, so the portal
already says what this application needs to know: how many files it holds
(`filesCount`), when it was made (`created`, which is when the firm asked) and
when it last changed (`updated`, which for a received one is the upload).
Who uploaded is on the file. A lawyer can add a request from ONLYOFFICE by
making a folder, or from here, and the two agree because they are the same
thing.

The names are matched without regard to case or spacing, so a folder renamed
by hand still counts. Everything else in the room — working files, drafts not
meant for the client — is left alone and, for the lawyer, counted at the
bottom.

To try it on your portal: open a matter's room in ONLYOFFICE, make a folder
`From the client` with a subfolder per document you want, and press
**Try again** or reopen the matter. Or press **Create the two folders** in a
room that has none.

## Reading a room one folder at a time

The portal answers for one folder per call: `getFolderByFolderId` returns
that folder's subfolders and files. So the screen reads the room's top level
to find the two sections, the checklist folder for its requests, every request
that holds something for its files, and the firm's folder for its drafts. An
empty request costs no call, because `filesCount` already says it is empty.

`readMatterRoom` is that walk with the "read one folder" step passed in, so
the same function runs against the SDK, against the demo folders, and in the
test with a map. That is also why the demo is interactive: **Ask for it** and
**Create the two folders** write into the same map the walk reads.

## The components, and why these

- **`CollapsibleCard`** for the two sections. Each has a title, a one-line
  summary that is useful when the body is closed ("3 of 5 received"), and a
  body the reader may not need — a client who has sent everything wants the
  firm's drafts, not the checklist.
- **`ProgressBar`** above the checklist, because "3 of 5" is a shape before
  it is a number. `label` is its accessible name; without it the bar is
  silent to a screen reader.
- **`ColumnarInfoBar`** with `variant="page"` for the matter's facts. The
  bar is label-and-value columns for context the reader does not act on,
  which is exactly what practice, stage and lead are here.
- **`EmptyView`** for a room that has no checklist folder yet. Its shape is
  a picture, a title, a sentence and a list of ways out — for a lawyer, the
  button that creates the two folders; for a client, no way out, because
  there is nothing for them to do.
- **`ComboBox`** to choose a matter. It keeps nothing: `selectedOption` is
  the screen's state and `onSelect` reports a click, so the same list can be
  driven from a URL later. `scaledOptions` matches the list's width to the
  button's.
- **`TextInput`** with `scale` and a `Button` of `type="submit"` in a form,
  so Enter asks for the document as well as the button does.
- The rows themselves are a list of the screen's own: a folder or file icon,
  a title, a line of detail and a badge. The kit's `Rows` is shaped around
  the portal's virtualised file list and says so in its README; a handful of
  lines is a flex column, not a component.

## Details worth copying

- **`filesCount` is the state.** A request is received when its folder is
  not empty; there is no flag to keep in step with the files.
- **The folder's `created` is when the firm asked**, and its `updated` is
  when the client answered. Both arrive as ISO strings, whatever the SDK's
  types say, and `isoOf` in `matter.ts` accepts either form.
- **Same URL shape for a folder as for a room.**
  `/rooms/shared/<folderId>/filter?folder=<folderId>` opens a subfolder on
  the portal, which is where "Upload it in ONLYOFFICE" sends a client until
  the next screen lets them do it here.
- **A file's `webUrl` is relative**, resolved against the portal's base URL
  the same way pictures are in
  [Connect to a portal](../setup/connect-to-a-portal.md).
- **The client sees the whole room in ONLYOFFICE.** Room membership is the
  portal's unit of access; the two folders are what the cabinet shows, not a
  wall. A working file the client must not see belongs in another room.
