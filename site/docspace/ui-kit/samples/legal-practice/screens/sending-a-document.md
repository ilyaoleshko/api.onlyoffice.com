# 03. Sending a document

The client's one job: hand over what the firm asked for. Press **Send it** on
a request still needed, drop a file, and the line turns green, because a
request is a folder and "received" means the folder is not empty.

<ThemedImage alt="Default" width={790} sources={{ light: require('./sending-a-document--default-light.png').default, dark: require('./sending-a-document--default-dark.png').default }} />

With no portal the drop goes into the demo rooms and the lawyer's view below
shows it arrive. Connect a portal and sign the client in from
[Who is signed in](../setup/who-is-signed-in.md),
and the file goes up to the request's folder under the client's own token;
press **Refresh** on the lawyer's side to see it.

## One component does the upload

`Uploader` is the kit's upload, the same one the portal runs: it opens an
upload session for the file in the target folder, sends the chunks several
at a time, and finalises the session into a file. It talks to the portal
through `useApi()`, so under the client's `ApiProvider` it uploads as the
client. The screen tells it one thing, `targetId`, which is the request's
folder id, and asks for one thing back, `onUploadSuccess`, on which the
checklist is read again.

With no portal there is no session to open, so the same control renders
`Dropzone`, the surface `Uploader` is built on, and hands the dropped files
to the screen, which puts them where the portal would have. Same look, same
`accept` list, same texts; only the destination differs.

## What changed on the previous screen

Nothing new was drawn. `MatterRoomPanel` took one prop, `sending`, and a
request still needed now offers **Send it** instead of a link to the portal.
The panel's hook gained `receive`, which re-reads the room after an upload,
and in demo mode first records the files. Everything the lawyer sees, the
progress bar and the badges, comes from the folder as before.

## Details worth copying

- **The client needs to be a content creator in the room.** A guest added as
  an editor or a viewer can read the folder and not add to it, and the
  portal answers 403 to the session. The demo-data page adds the client with
  that role; a firm doing it by hand picks the same one.
- **`accept` is the kit's dropzone form**: extensions with the dot, comma
  separated. The text next to it is yours, and `badgeValue` is the "+N"
  after the short list.
- **A finished upload is a toast**, raised by `Uploader` itself, with a link
  to the folder when `getFolderUrl` is given. `Toast` has to be mounted once
  on the page for it to show; the cabinet mounts it in its frame.
- **`onUploadSuccess` is the moment to re-read**, not to update state by
  hand: the portal has the file, the folder's `filesCount` has moved, and the
  screen already knows how to read that.
