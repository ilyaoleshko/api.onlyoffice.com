# 01. My matters

The first screen anyone at the firm opens, and the first one a client opens:
the matters that are theirs. A lawyer wants to know which ones need attention;
a client wants to know what is happening and who to ask.

With no portal configured, both lists are demo data. Connect a portal from the
**API** control in the toolbar and the left list becomes the key owner's real
matters; register the sample's OAuth app in
[Who is signed in](../setup/who-is-signed-in.md)
and the right one signs a client in as themselves.

## A matter is a room with two tags

Nothing is stored anywhere but the portal. A matter is a room, and the two
things a room does not already say are carried by its tags:

| Tag | Example | What it does |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `Practice: …` | `Practice: Employment` | names the area of law — and makes the room a matter at all |
| `Stage: …` | `Stage: Discovery` | says where it stands: Intake, Discovery, Negotiation, Hearing or Closed |

Tags, because they are the one piece of free metadata a room has: the portal
shows them as chips, filters rooms by them, and lets a lawyer change them
without this application. The prefix keeps them readable in the portal's own
list, where every room's tags live together. Any other tag passes through and
is shown to the lawyer as it is; a stage outside the five is kept as written and
drawn without the accent, so a firm can add its own.

Everything else comes from the room: its title, who opened it (the lead
lawyer), when it last changed, how many documents and sections it holds.

To try it on your portal: open a room in ONLYOFFICE, add the tags
`Practice: Employment` and `Stage: Intake`, and press **Refresh**.

## One list, two readers

`useMatters()` never asks *whose* matters. It lists what the nearest
`ApiProvider` may see:

- under the provider Storybook mounts, that is the **API key** — the lawyer who
  owns it, and every matter they were added to;
- under a nested provider holding a client's **OAuth token**, the very same
  code gets only the rooms shared with that client.

The portal does the filtering, because the portal is what knows who may see
what. A client cabinet that fetched every room and filtered by the client's name
would be one edit away from showing a client someone else's matter.

`getSelfProfile()` says who is asking, and the persona from
[Who is signed in](../setup/who-is-signed-in.md)
decides only
the wording. A lawyer gets the practice, the lead, the document count, search and
a filter by stage. A client gets a sentence about what the stage means for them
and the name of their lawyer — the same room, told for a different reader.

Rooms are read a hundred at a time, active ones only, up to 500. That is a
sample's limit, not a portal's: a practice with thousands of matters passes
`filterValue` to `getRoomsFolder` and searches on the server.

## Details worth copying

- **`updated` arrives as a string.** The SDK types it as an object with
  `utcTime`; the portal sends an ISO timestamp. `matterFromRoom` takes both.
- **A room's picture is either a cover or a protected file.** A cover the portal
  drew comes inline as SVG data, and `RoomIcon` recolours it. An uploaded
  picture is a `/storage/…` path that answers 403 unsigned, so it goes through
  `usePortalImage` from
  [Connect to a portal](../setup/connect-to-a-portal.md),
  under
  whichever token the list runs with. With neither, `RoomIcon` draws the
  initials on the room's colour.
- **The room's page on the portal** is `/rooms/shared/<id>/filter?folder=<id>`,
  for a guest as much as for a lawyer.
- **Demo data has the portal's shape.** The demo rooms are what
  `getRoomsFolder` returns, and go through the same `matterFromRoom`; the two
  lists imitate the portal's two answers instead of filtering one list.
