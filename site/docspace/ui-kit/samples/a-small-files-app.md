# A small Files app

A Files application on one screen: the rooms, the personal folder and the
trash in the sidebar; folders opened in place, with a breadcrumb back;
search, a type filter and a sort order; rows or tiles; a selection toolbar;
new folders and documents, renames and deletes; uploads; files opened in
ONLYOFFICE.

Below it runs on a tree in memory. Add a portal in the **API provider**
toolbar -- [Connect to a portal](./legal-practice/setup/connect-to-a-portal.md)
says how -- and the same screen reads that portal, as the owner of the key.
Nothing in the component changes; the sidebar heading drops its "(demo)".

<ThemedImage alt="Default" width={790} sources={{ light: require('./a-small-files-app--default-light.png').default, dark: require('./a-small-files-app--default-dark.png').default }} />

Open **Finance department**. Search for `budget`. Switch to tiles. Tick two
files and watch the breadcrumb header become a toolbar. **Create → New
folder**; then open the folder's menu and rename it. Move something to Trash
and find it there.

The filter panel, the dialogs and the context menus are portals into the
page's own `<body>` -- which is the whole application on a real screen, and
this whole article here. Open the sample on its own, from **Default** in the
sidebar, to see them the way an application does.

## Who owns what

This is the one idea worth taking from the file: **layout, data and state
never negotiate.**

- **`Article`** is the sidebar. It owns collapsing, the mobile drawer, the
  main button slot and the profile block. You give it entries.
- **`Section`** is everything to the right, as five named slots --
  `SectionHeader`, `SectionFilter`, `SectionBody`, `SectionFooter`, plus the
  info panel. It owns the sticky header, the scroll container and the
  breakpoints.
- **`FilesSource`** is the data: one `list(query)` that answers a `Listing`,
  and four writes. `portalSource` is the SDK behind `useApi()`; `demoSource`
  is a tree in memory with the same shape. The screen cannot tell them apart,
  which is what lets one page work both with and without a portal.
- **The component** owns what is left: where the reader is (`Query`), what
  they searched for, what they selected, which view is on, which dialog is
  open. No component here has an opinion about any of it, which is why the
  same `Section` carries rows on one click and tiles on the next.

That is also what makes the header trick a two-line change: while something
is selected, render `TableGroupMenu` in `SectionHeader` instead of
`Navigation`. The body does not know the difference.

## The device type is a prop, so it has to come from somewhere

`Article`, `Section`, `Navigation` and `Filter` take `currentDeviceType`
rather than measuring the window: on the portal it is one store value every
screen agrees on. Here `useDeviceType` reads it off the viewport with the
kit's own breakpoints, and everything follows from that one value, the way
it does in the client:

- **Desktop**: the sidebar is 243px wide and carries the `Create` button.
- **Tablet**: the sidebar folds to 60px from the arrow at its foot, the
  heading gives way to a mark, and there is no wide button to clip -- the
  `Article` reports `isMobileArticle`, and the actions move to
  `MainButtonMobile`, the floating button at the foot of the screen. It goes
  away where nothing can be created.
- **Phone**: the sidebar becomes a drawer, and the floating button stays.

Narrow the window on this page to watch the switch. Passing a constant
`DeviceType.desktop` instead, as an earlier version of this sample did, left
the sidebar able to fold and the button unable to follow.

## What the portal is asked

Every control on the screen is a call the portal already answers. The kit's
`ApiProvider` makes the typed clients once; `useApi()` hands them out.

| On screen                         | Call                                                             |
| --------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Rooms                             | `roomsApi.getRoomsFolder({ searchArea: Active })`                |
| A room or a folder                | `foldersApi.getFolderByFolderId({ folderId })`                   |
| My documents, Trash               | `foldersApi.getMyFolder()`, `foldersApi.getTrashFolder()`        |
| Search, Type filter, Sort by      | `filterValue`, `filterType`, `sortBy` + `sortOrder` on the same  |
| Breadcrumb                        | the listing's `pathParts`, without the current folder, reversed  |
| Create → New folder               | `foldersApi.createFolder({ folderId, createFolder: { title } })` |
| Create → New document             | `filesApi.createFile({ folderId, createFileJsonElement })`       |
| Rename                            | `filesApi.updateFile`, `foldersApi.renameFolder`                 |
| Move to Trash, Delete permanently | `operationsApi.deleteBatchItems`, then `getOperationStatuses`    |
| Upload files                      | `Uploader` with the folder's numeric id as `targetId`            |
| Open in ONLYOFFICE, Copy link     | the file's `webUrl`, resolved against the provider's `baseUrl`   |

Three things about those calls that the types do not say:

- **A folder's contents come one folder per call**, and the search, the
  filter and the sort are parameters of that call. Typing in the search box
  is therefore a request, so the query is debounced exactly where the request
  is made -- `useDebounce` in the component -- and never inside `Filter`.
- **Deletes run in the background.** The batch call answers with an
  operation, not with the result, so `portalSource.remove` polls
  `getOperationStatuses` until it is finished before the folder is read
  again; without that the deleted row would still be there.
- **The rooms list takes no type filter.** `getRoomsFolder` filters by room
  type, not by file type, so at the Rooms root the page is narrowed on the
  client. Everywhere else the portal does it.

## What to expect on a real portal

- **Everything runs as the owner of the key.** Rooms are the rooms that
  person is in; My documents is theirs. A guest's key has no My documents,
  and the listing says so instead of showing an empty folder -- the portal
  answers 403 and the sample repeats it.
- **Rooms are opened, not selected.** The toolbar's one action is a delete,
  and the portal archives a room before it lets anyone delete it, so rooms
  carry no checkbox here.
- **Uploads need a content creator's rights** in the room; a viewer gets 403
  on the upload session and the uploader's toast says so.
- **The first hundred entries are shown.** The count line says when a folder
  holds more; a real application pages with `startIndex`.

## Where to go next

- **Samples → Legal practice** for an application built around one problem,
  with OAuth for a second identity and a seeder for demo data.
- **Components → Uploader** for the upload session this screen opens, and
  **Components → Document Editor** for opening a file in place instead of in
  a new tab.
- **Getting started → API** for the clients `useApi()` hands out.
