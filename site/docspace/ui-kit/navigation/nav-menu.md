# NavMenu

Sidebar navigation: groups of items, each with an optional sub-menu, a badge and a collapsed rail
form. It owns which section is expanded and nothing else — what is active, and what a click does,
come from you.

<ThemedImage alt="NavMenu" width={266} sources={{ light: require('./nav-menu-light.png').default, dark: require('./nav-menu-dark.png').default }} />

## Use this when / not when

- Use for the left-hand navigation of an application: a handful of groups, each a short list of
  destinations, some of them with children.
- Not for a menu that pops open — [`DropDown`](../overlays/drop-down.md) and
  [`ContextMenu`](../overlays/context-menu.md) are the floating ones.
- Not for the portal's own sidebar chrome — [`Article`](https://github.com/ONLYOFFICE/docspace-ui-kit-react/blob/master/components/article/README.md) is the panel with the
  header, the resize handle and the mobile behaviour; this is the list that goes inside it.
- **There is no router.** Give it `LinkRouter` and each entry with `linkData` becomes your link
  component; without it every entry is a `<button>` and `linkData` is ignored.
- **A section header is never a link.** An item with `children` is always rendered as a button,
  whatever `linkData` says.

## Import

```ts
import { NavMenu } from "@onlyoffice/apps-ui-kit/components/nav-menu";
```

Also exported from the root barrel `@onlyoffice/apps-ui-kit`, together with two icon components
this folder re-exports — `ArticleHideMenuIcon` and `CatalogSettingsPaymentIcon`.

Needs `ThemeProvider` above it in the tree for every colour it paints. In the collapsed form the
labels become tooltips through the kit's shared tooltip, which needs `<RootTooltip />` from
[`Tooltip`](../overlays/tooltip.md) mounted once near the root of the application — without it a
collapsed rail has no labels at all.

## Minimal example

```tsx
import { useState } from "react";

import { NavMenu } from "@onlyoffice/apps-ui-kit/components/nav-menu";

const groups = [
  {
    id: "main",
    label: "Workspace",
    items: [
      { id: "overview", label: "Overview" },
      {
        id: "documents",
        label: "Documents",
        children: [
          { id: "recent", label: "Recent" },
          { id: "favourites", label: "Favourites" },
          { id: "trash", label: "Trash", withTopSeparator: true },
        ],
      },
    ],
  },
];

export function Sidebar() {
  const [active, setActive] = useState("overview");

  return (
    <NavMenu
      groups={groups.map((group) => ({
        ...group,
        items: group.items.map((item) => ({
          ...item,
          onClick: () => setActive(item.id),
          children: item.children?.map((sub) => ({
            ...sub,
            onClick: () => setActive(sub.id),
          })),
        })),
      }))}
      activeItemId={active}
    />
  );
}
```

## Props


<APITable>

| Property | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `groups` | `NavMenuGroup[]` | The sections of the menu, in order. A group with a `label` renders it as a caption above its items. |
| `activeItemId`? | `string` | Id of the item or sub-item that is currently open. It highlights that entry and, through an effect, expands the section it belongs to. |
| `className`? | `string` | Added after the component's own classes on the `nav` element. |
| `defaultExpandedId`? | `string` | Section expanded on the first render. After that the expansion is the component's own state. |
| `iconOnly`? | `boolean` | Collapsed rail: labels become tooltips, sub-menus are not rendered, and the active section's children are flattened into the list instead. Default: `false`. |
| `LinkRouter`? | `React.ComponentType<LinkRouterProps>` | Your router's link component. Without it `linkData` is ignored and every entry is a `button`. |
| `withAnimation`? | `boolean` | Plays the sliding highlight when an entry is clicked. Default: `false`. |
| `withExpandControl`? | `boolean` | Gives each section its own chevron and leaves the item body to navigation. Several sections may then be open at once. Default: `false`. |

</APITable>

#### Added by the wrapper the folder exports

The `index` module exports a wrapped component, so these are accepted on top of the props above.

<APITable>

| Property | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `ref`? | `Ref<HTMLElement>` | Allows getting a ref to the component instance. Once the component unmounts, React will set `ref.current` to `null` (or call the ref with `null` if you passed a callback ref). |

</APITable>

## Recipes

### With a router

`LinkRouter` is your router's link component. Only leaf items use it: an item with children stays
a button, because clicking it expands its sub-menu.

```tsx
import { NavMenu } from "@onlyoffice/apps-ui-kit/components/nav-menu";
import type { LinkRouterProps } from "@onlyoffice/apps-ui-kit/types";

const groups = [
  {
    id: "main",
    items: [
      { id: "overview", label: "Overview", linkData: { path: "/" } },
      {
        id: "documents",
        label: "Documents",
        children: [
          { id: "recent", label: "Recent", linkData: { path: "/recent" } },
          { id: "trash", label: "Trash", linkData: { path: "/trash" } },
        ],
      },
    ],
  },
];

function RouterLink({ to, children, ...rest }: LinkRouterProps) {
  return (
    <a href={String(to)} {...rest}>
      {children}
    </a>
  );
}

export function RoutedSidebar({ path }: { path: string }) {
  return (
    <NavMenu
      groups={groups}
      LinkRouter={RouterLink}
      activeItemId={path === "/" ? "overview" : path.slice(1)}
    />
  );
}
```

### The collapsed rail

`iconOnly` hides the labels and the sub-menus. The active section's children are flattened into
the top-level list instead, so the current branch stays reachable.

```tsx
import { useState } from "react";

import { NavMenu } from "@onlyoffice/apps-ui-kit/components/nav-menu";
import { Button } from "@onlyoffice/apps-ui-kit/components/button";
import { RootTooltip } from "@onlyoffice/apps-ui-kit/components/tooltip";

const groups = [
  {
    id: "main",
    items: [
      { id: "overview", label: "Overview", icon: "/icons/home.svg" },
      {
        id: "documents",
        label: "Documents",
        icon: "/icons/docs.svg",
        children: [
          { id: "recent", label: "Recent" },
          { id: "trash", label: "Trash" },
        ],
      },
    ],
  },
];

export function CollapsibleSidebar() {
  const [collapsed, setCollapsed] = useState(false);

  return (
    <>
      <RootTooltip />
      <Button
        label={collapsed ? "Expand" : "Collapse"}
        onClick={() => setCollapsed((value) => !value)}
      />
      <NavMenu groups={groups} iconOnly={collapsed} activeItemId="recent" />
    </>
  );
}
```

### Badges

`showBadge` puts a dot on the icon and the kit's badge beside the label. `badgeComponent` replaces
that badge, and `collapsedBadgeComponent` is what a section shows while its sub-menu is shut —
the place for an aggregated count.

```tsx
import { NavMenu } from "@onlyoffice/apps-ui-kit/components/nav-menu";
import { Badge } from "@onlyoffice/apps-ui-kit/components/badge";

const groups = [
  {
    id: "main",
    items: [
      {
        id: "documents",
        label: "Documents",
        collapsedBadgeComponent: <Badge label={12} />,
        children: [
          { id: "recent", label: "Recent", showBadge: true, labelBadge: 9 },
          { id: "shared", label: "Shared", showBadge: true, labelBadge: 3 },
        ],
      },
    ],
  },
];

export function BadgedSidebar() {
  return <NavMenu groups={groups} activeItemId="recent" />;
}
```

### A click that opens a dialog

An `onClick` that returns exactly `false` tells the menu the interaction was handled, so the
section does not expand behind whatever you opened. Any other return value, a promise included,
keeps the default.

```tsx
import { useState } from "react";

import { NavMenu } from "@onlyoffice/apps-ui-kit/components/nav-menu";
import { ModalDialog } from "@onlyoffice/apps-ui-kit/components/modal-dialog";

export function SidebarWithDialog() {
  const [open, setOpen] = useState(false);

  const groups = [
    {
      id: "main",
      items: [
        { id: "overview", label: "Overview" },
        {
          id: "invite",
          label: "Invite people",
          children: [{ id: "invite-link", label: "Copy link" }],
          onClick: () => {
            setOpen(true);
            return false as const;
          },
        },
      ],
    },
  ];

  return (
    <>
      <NavMenu groups={groups} activeItemId="overview" />
      <ModalDialog visible={open} onClose={() => setOpen(false)}>
        <ModalDialog.Header>Invite people</ModalDialog.Header>
        <ModalDialog.Body>Share the link with your team.</ModalDialog.Body>
      </ModalDialog>
    </>
  );
}
```

## Behaviour the types don't state

- **Expansion is the component's own state, and `activeItemId` drives it.** An effect finds the
  section the active id belongs to and opens it — so navigating from outside the menu opens the
  right branch by itself. An id that matches nothing leaves the state untouched.
- **Desktop and mobile expand differently.** By default only one section is open at a time and the
  active one cannot be collapsed by clicking it again; with `withExpandControl` each section gets
  its own chevron, the item body no longer toggles anything, and several sections may be open at
  once.
- **A childless active item collapses everything** on the default behaviour — that is how an
  "Overview" entry shuts the open section.
- **A sub-menu opens with a height and opacity transition**, which `prefers-reduced-motion: reduce`
  turns off.
- **`iconOnly` hides the group captions as well as the labels**; groups are then set apart by
  their spacing alone.
- **`iconOnly` drops the sub-menus entirely** and rebuilds the active section's children as
  top-level entries, each with a staggered reveal animation. A sub-item's `onClick` is rewrapped in
  the process, and `withTopSeparator` is lost.
- **`endOfActiveSection`, `isFlattenedChild` and `flattenIndex` are internal.** The component sets
  them while flattening; passing them yourself does nothing outside that mode.
- **Only a leaf can be a link.** The link branch requires the item to have no children, so a
  section header is always a `<button>` even when it carries `linkData`.
- **`linkData` without `LinkRouter` is ignored**, silently.
- **In the collapsed rail the label is a tooltip**, delivered through the kit's shared tooltip —
  which renders nothing unless `<RootTooltip />` is mounted somewhere in the application.
- **`icon` is fetched over the network** as an SVG when the menu renders; `iconNode` is rendered as
  given and wins over it.
- **Clicks on a badge do not reach the item.** The badge wrapper stops both click and key events, so
  `onClickBadge` is the only handler that fires there.
- **The folder re-exports two icons into the root barrel** — `ArticleHideMenuIcon` and
  `CatalogSettingsPaymentIcon` — which is how they end up in the package's public surface.

## CSS variables

| Variable                            | Default                  | Effect                                                                     |
| ----------------------------------- | ------------------------ | -------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `--nav-menu-group-label-color`      | theme-based              | Group caption text                                                         |
| `--nav-menu-item-text-color`        | theme-based              | Item and sub-item labels                                                   |
| `--nav-menu-item-text-active-color` | theme-based (the accent) | Label of the active entry                                                  |
| `--nav-menu-item-icon-color`        | theme-based              | Item and sub-item icons, and the chevron of `withExpandControl`            |
| `--nav-menu-item-icon-active-color` | theme-based (the accent) | Icon of the active entry, and the keyboard focus outline                   |
| `--nav-menu-item-bg-hover`          | theme-based              | Highlight under the entry the pointer is on                                |
| `--nav-menu-item-bg-active`         | theme-based              | Highlight under the active entry                                           |
| `--nav-menu-signal-dot-color`       | theme-based (the accent) | Dot on the icon of an entry with a badge; only the collapsed rail shows it |
| `--nav-menu-separator-color`        | none — no line is drawn  | Line above a sub-item with `withTopSeparator`                              |

**Every variable but the last is declared on the menu's own `nav` element**, under the theme
class (`.light .root`, `.dark .root`), so a value set on a wrapper never arrives. Set them in a
rule that outranks that one and pass its class through `className` — `.light nav.my-nav` does.

`--nav-menu-separator-color` is declared nowhere: the line falls back to `--quick-buttons-color`,
which the kit does not define either, so without one of the two set there is no line at all.

The sliding highlight is driven by `--end-width` and `--flatten-index`, which the component sets
itself on each animated element.

## Accessibility

- The root is a `<nav>`, each group is a `<ul>` and each entry a `<li>`, so the structure is
  announced.
- Entries are real `<button>`s, or your `LinkRouter` element, and are reachable and operable from
  the keyboard.
- A section that expands on its own body click carries `aria-expanded`; with `withExpandControl`
  the flag moves to the chevron, which is labelled with the section's name.
- Keyboard focus is drawn as a 2px outline inside the entry, in
  `--nav-menu-item-icon-active-color`; the pointer never shows it.
- **The `<nav>` has no `aria-label`.** Give it one through a wrapper when the page has more than
  one navigation landmark.
- **In the collapsed rail the accessible name is the tooltip title.** It is set on the button, so
  it is announced even without the tooltip being mounted — but sighted users see nothing.
- Group labels are `<span>`s, not headings, and are not tied to their list with
  `aria-labelledby`.

## Test ids

The component sets none. Every entry carries `data-item-id` with the item's own id; select on that,
or on the `nav` element.
