# EmptyView

Centred empty state with an icon, a title, a description and a list of things the user can do
next. It places itself, so it goes straight into the region it fills.

<ThemedImage alt="EmptyView" width={318} sources={{ light: require('./empty-view-light.png').default, dark: require('./empty-view-dark.png').default }} />

## Use this when / not when

- Use when a list, a room or a panel has nothing in it and the user can act on that: create
  something, invite someone, change a filter.
- Not when the emptiness is the result of an error — [`ErrorContainer`](./error-container.md)
  is the one with the error framing.
- Not when content is on its way: a skeleton such as
  [`RectangleSkeleton`](../skeletons/rectangle.md) says "wait", while this one says "there is
  nothing".
- Not for the portal's own empty screens, which carry their own imagery and layout: that is
  [`EmptyScreenContainer`](./empty-screen-container.md).

## Import

```ts
import { EmptyView } from "@onlyoffice/apps-ui-kit/components/empty-view";
```

Also exported from the root barrel `@onlyoffice/apps-ui-kit`.

Needs `ThemeProvider` from `@onlyoffice/apps-ui-kit/providers/theme` above it in the tree for
the title, description and item colours.

## Minimal example

`options` is required; pass `null` for an empty state with nothing to do.

```tsx
import { EmptyView } from "@onlyoffice/apps-ui-kit/components/empty-view";

export function NoRooms({ onCreate }: { onCreate: () => void }) {
  return (
    <EmptyView
      icon={
        <svg viewBox="0 0 96 96" width="96" height="96" aria-hidden="true">
          <rect
            x="8"
            y="8"
            width="80"
            height="80"
            rx="8"
            fill="none"
            stroke="currentColor"
          />
        </svg>
      }
      title="No rooms yet"
      description="Rooms are where you collaborate on files with other people."
      options={[
        {
          key: "create",
          type: "button",
          title: "Create a room",
          onClick: onCreate,
        },
      ]}
    />
  );
}
```

## Recipes

### A list of suggestions with a separator

```tsx
import { EmptyView } from "@onlyoffice/apps-ui-kit/components/empty-view";

const ICON = (
  <svg viewBox="0 0 24 24" width="24" height="24" aria-hidden="true">
    <circle cx="12" cy="12" r="10" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" />
  </svg>
);

export function EmptyFolder({
  onUpload,
  onCreateFile,
}: {
  onUpload: () => void;
  onCreateFile: () => void;
}) {
  return (
    <EmptyView
      icon={ICON}
      title="This folder is empty"
      description="Add the first file to it."
      options={[
        {
          key: "upload",
          type: "action",
          title: "Upload a file",
          icon: ICON,
          onClick: onUpload,
        },
        { key: "or", type: "separator", text: "or" },
        {
          key: "create",
          type: "action",
          title: "Create a document",
          icon: ICON,
          onClick: onCreateFile,
        },
      ]}
    />
  );
}
```

## Behaviour the types don't state

- **It positions itself.** The wrapper is `margin-inline: auto`, `width: 100%`, capped at
  `--empty-view-width` (480px), with `--empty-view-padding-top` of 61px — 40px on mobile — and
  an 18px gap between its parts. Put it directly in the region it fills; a wrapper of your own
  that centres it again will fight it.
- **Option types are told apart by shape, not only by `type`.** An option with a `to` field is
  a link whatever else it carries; `button`, `separator` and `action` are matched on `type`;
  anything else falls through to an item. A link option therefore cannot also be a button.
- **A link option without `LinkRouter` silently stops navigating.** It renders as an action
  link with the same icon and text, and the `to` you passed is ignored. Pass your router's
  `Link` component, or use an `action` option with an `onClick`.
- `isNext: true` has the same effect on purpose, for a link that should run a handler rather
  than navigate.
- An item with a `model` opens that context menu on click and does not call its `onClick`.
- An item with `disabled: true` is not rendered at all — there is no greyed-out state.
- A `button` option is `primary` unless you say otherwise, and is always `ButtonSize.small`.
- `extraContent` renders between the header and the options, outside the body element, so it
  does not take the body's gap.

## CSS variables

| `--empty-view-link-accent`           | theme       | Text colour of a link option, and of its icon's `<g>` fill |
| `--empty-view-link-background`       | theme       | Background of a link option                                |
| `--empty-view-link-hover-background` | theme       | Background of a link option under the pointer              |
| `--empty-view-link-padding`          | `6px 10px`  | Padding inside a link option                               |
| `--empty-view-link-radius`           | `6px`       | Corner radius of a link option                             |
| `--empty-view-link-text-size`        | `13px`      | Font size of a link option                                 |
| `--empty-view-link-text-weight`      | `600`       | Font weight of a link option                               |
| `--empty-view-icon-size`             | `36px`      | Icon size inside an item                                   |
| `--empty-view-item-padding`          | `12px 16px` | Padding inside an item                                     |
| `--empty-view-item-radius`           | `6px`       | Corner radius of an item                                   |
| `--empty-view-item-gap`              | `20px`      | Gap between an item's icon, text and arrow                 |
| `--empty-view-item-hover-background` | theme       | Background of an item under the pointer                    |
| `--empty-view-item-title-color`      | theme       | Title colour of an item                                    |
| `--empty-view-item-desc-color`       | theme       | Description colour of an item                              |
| `--empty-view-divider-color`         | theme       | Text colour of a `separator` option                        |

`--empty-view-link-accent` loses to `--accent-main`: wherever the host page defines that
token, it colours the link options instead. An `action` option has no variable of its own —
its colour is `--accent-main`, or a fixed blue without it. The pressed backgrounds of links and
items have no override either.

## Accessibility

- The title renders as an `<h3>` and the description as a `<p>`; the wrapper has no landmark
  role, so place it inside your own region.
- An item is a `<div>` with `role="button"`, `tabIndex={0}` and an `aria-label` of its
  `title`, so it is in the Tab order and announced by its title — but it has no key handler,
  so Enter and Space do not activate it.
- An `action` option is a `<div>` with `role="button"` and `tabIndex={0}`, named by its own
  text; it has no key handler either, so Enter and Space do not activate it.
- A `button` option is a native `<button>`, activated by Enter and Space. A link option is
  whatever your `LinkRouter` renders; without one (or with `isNext`) it is an `<a>` with no
  `href`, which has no role and is not in the Tab order.
- The icon you pass is rendered as given; mark it `aria-hidden` unless it carries meaning the
  title does not.

## Test ids

| Element          | `data-testid`     |
| ---------------- | ----------------- |
| The wrapper      | `empty-view`      |
| The options body | `empty-view-body` |

Neither can be overridden by a prop.
