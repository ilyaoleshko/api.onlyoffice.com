# RoomSelector

RoomSelector is a searchable, paginated selector for choosing rooms from the ONLYOFFICE Apps system.

### Features

- **Live API mode** — Fetches rooms from the ONLYOFFICE Apps API with infinite scroll
- **Single / multi-select** — Controlled by `isMultiSelect`
- **Room type filter** — Pass `roomType` to restrict the list to specific room types
- **Search** — Enable with `withSearch`
- **Third-party rooms** — Optionally hide third-party storage rooms via `disableThirdParty`
- **Room creation** — Show a create-room button via `withCreate` + `createDefineRoomLabel`
- **Pre-selection** — Pass `selectedItems` with `sortSelectedFirst` to float already-selected rooms to the top
- **Header / aside / cancel** — Fully composable via `withHeader`, `useAside`, `withCancelButton`
