# Providers

The providers an application mounts above the components. `ThemeProvider` and `TranslationProvider` are required -- without them components render unstyled and without text -- and `ErrorBoundary` catches a render failure below it.

## Overview

The following components are available:

| Provider | Description |
| --- | --- |
| [`ErrorProvider`](./error-boundary.md) | Catches what the subtree throws while rendering and shows something in its place. |
| [`ThemeProvider`](./theme.md) | Resolves the light, dark or system theme and writes it onto the document for every component to read. |
| [`TranslationProvider`](./translation.md) | Installs the i18next instance the eleven components with labels of their own read from. |
