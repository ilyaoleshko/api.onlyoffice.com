# addFavorites

> BooleanWrapper addFavorites(BaseBatchRequestDto)

`POST /api/2.0/files/favorites`

Add favorite files and folders

Marks the listed files and folders as favorites for the calling account. The favorite list is personal: nothing changes for other members, and the entries stay where they are stored. Read access to each item is enough, so a room member with view-only rights and a guest may call it. Items the caller cannot read, ids that do not exist and encrypted files of a private room are skipped without a word, and the answer is `true` even when nothing was marked, so read the outcome back from `GET api/2.0/files/@favorites` instead of trusting it. Numeric ids address entries stored in the portal itself, string ids entries on a connected third-party account, and both kinds may be sent in one request. The call is mutating but safe to repeat: an item already marked stays listed once. An entry moved to the Trash keeps its mark and is left out of the listing until it is restored. `returnSingleOperation` arrives with the shared body and does nothing here. Use `DELETE api/2.0/files/favorites` to undo, or `GET api/2.0/files/favorites/{fileId}` for a single file.
