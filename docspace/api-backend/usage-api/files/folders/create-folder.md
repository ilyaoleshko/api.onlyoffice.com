# createFolder

> FolderIntegerWrapper createFolder(folderId, CreateFolder)

`POST /api/2.0/files/folder/{folderId}`

Create a folder

Creates a folder inside the folder named in the path and answers with the folder as it was stored. The title is trimmed, may not be blank and is refused when it is longer than the limit the schema prints; titles are not required to be unique, so creating the same title twice leaves two folders side by side, which makes the call mutating and not idempotent. The caller needs the right to create content in the parent, which the room manager, a content creator and the owner of a personal section have; a member without that right, an archived parent, and a section root that only holds rooms - Rooms, Forms and AI agents - are all refused, as is a parent that does not exist. Rooms are not created here: use `POST api/2.0/files/rooms` for those, and this operation for ordinary folders within them. Members of the room are notified of the new folder. Read the identifier of the new folder from `id` and fill it with `POST api/2.0/files/{folderId}/upload`.
