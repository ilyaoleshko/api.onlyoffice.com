# createRoom

> FolderIntegerWrapper createRoom(CreateRoomRequestDto)

`POST /api/2.0/files/rooms`

Create a room

Creates a room in the portal Rooms section and returns it. `roomType` decides which sharing links, member roles and form features the room offers, and it cannot be changed afterwards, so a room of the wrong kind has to be recreated. The caller must be the portal owner, a portal administrator or a room administrator; a user or a guest is refused, and so is a public room while the portal forbids external sharing. `title` is required and must not be blank: characters a folder name cannot hold are replaced with underscores and the rest is truncated, so the stored title can differ from the one sent and two rooms can share it. `quota` is accepted only while the per-room quota feature is on and must stay within the portal quota, `cover` only for an id returned by `GET api/2.0/files/rooms/covers`, and `color` as six hexadecimal digits with no leading number sign. Tag names the portal does not know yet are added to the tag catalogue. `share` is not implemented and any non-empty value is rejected, so invite members afterwards with `PUT api/2.0/files/rooms/{id}/share`. Passing the portal room limit ends the call as a billing refusal and creates nothing.
