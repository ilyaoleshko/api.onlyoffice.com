# deleteBackupHistory

> BooleanWrapper deleteBackupHistory(Dump)

`DELETE /api/2.0/backup/deletebackuphistory`

Delete the backup history

Deletes every backup of the current portal, both the history records and the archives themselves, and leaves the backup schedule alone. `dump` clears the backups of the whole server instead and requires the space access permission. The records are walked one by one and a failure on any of them is swallowed, so the result is always true even when some archives could not be deleted: it does not mean the history is now empty. Call `GET api/2.0/backup/getbackuphistory` afterwards to see what is left. Each record is removed before its archive, so an archive whose deletion fails stays in the storage with nothing pointing at it.

## Parameters

|Name | In | Type | Description | Notes |
|------------- | ------------- | ------------- | ------------- | -------------|
| **Dump** | query | **Boolean** | Applies the operation to the whole server rather than to the current portal, which requires the space access permission and works on a standalone installation only. Server-wide backups and schedules are kept apart from the ones of a portal, so the two values address different data. | [optional] [example: `false`] |
