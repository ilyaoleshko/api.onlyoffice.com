`DELETE /api/2.0/ai/assignments/cascade-profile-delete`

Cascade profile delete

Detaches a profile from every assignment that points at it, which is the cleanup step before the profile itself is removed. The `Default` slot is promoted to the first remaining profile, or dropped when none is left, and every other slot holding the profile is cleared. `profileId` is required and may be sent in the body or as a query parameter. `DELETE api/2.0/ai/profiles/delete` already does this, so call it directly only when the profile is being removed by some other means.
