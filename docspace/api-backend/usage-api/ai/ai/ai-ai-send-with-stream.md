# aiAiSendWithStream

> AiChatEvent aiAiSendWithStream(AiAiSendStreamBody)

`POST /api/2.0/ai/ai/send-with-stream`

Send with stream

Runs one chat round and streams it back as newline-delimited `ChatEvent` objects. Omitting `threadId` opens a new thread, which requires that `entityId` names a room the caller can open and that a profile resolves for it; the user message and the reply are persisted either way, and a new thread also gets a generated title. The model is settled in a fixed order - an agent's assignment in scope overrides everything, then the explicit `profileId`, then the one stored on the thread, then the `Chat` assignment - and the effective profile is checked before the stream opens, so an unknown one fails with 400 rather than as an error buried in a 200. A tool call pauses the round and ends the stream; resume it with `POST api/2.0/ai/ai/approve-tool-call` or `POST api/2.0/ai/ai/deny-tool-call`.
